# EELE468_Lab5
Using the echo from lab 4, convert the model to VHDL and put it on our DE10Nano FPGA.

The code was obtained form simulink's HDL Workflow Advisor. It was then memory mapped using the FPGA's avalon bus, and the control registers were changed in linux. The changes could be heard through the FPGA's audio mini board.
